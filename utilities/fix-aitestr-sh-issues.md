Steps to Fix AIDocs testR Permission Issues

Make the main script executable:

cd /Users/Shared/repos/AIDocs_testR
chmod +x run-tests.sh

Make all shell scripts executable:

chmod +x *.sh

Make all shell scripts in subdirectories executable:

find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

Install Node.js dependencies:

cd ._2
npm install

Summary

The issue was caused by:

Missing execute permissions on shell scripts

Missing Node.js dependencies (specifically the dotenv package)

After these steps, the ait s11 t011 command should work properly.
