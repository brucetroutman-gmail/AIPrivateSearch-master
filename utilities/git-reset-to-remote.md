Here's the modified bash script that asks which subfolder to process:

## The Modified Script

Create a file called `git-reset-to-remote.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to reset a repository subfolder to match remote repository exactly
# WARNING: This will permanently delete all local changes!

set -e  # Exit on any error

echo "🔄 Repository Reset Tool"
echo "⚠️  WARNING: This will permanently delete all local changes!"
echo ""

# Function to list available git repositories
list_repos() {
    echo "📁 Available git repositories in current directory:"
    local count=0
    for dir in */; do
        if [ -d "$dir.git" ]; then
            echo "   - $dir"
            ((count++))
        fi
    done
    
    if [ $count -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "   No git repositories found in current directory."
        return 1
    fi
    return 0
}

# Show current directory
echo "📍 Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo ""

# List available repositories
if ! list_repos; then
    echo "❌ No git repositories found. Please run this from a directory containing git repos."
    exit 1
fi

echo ""

# Ask for subfolder name
while true; do
    read -p "📂 Enter the subfolder name (e.g., myApp): " SUBFOLDER
    
    if [ -z "$SUBFOLDER" ]; then
        echo "❌ Please enter a subfolder name."
        continue
    fi
    
    # Remove trailing slash if present
    SUBFOLDER=${SUBFOLDER%/}
    
    if [ ! -d "$SUBFOLDER" ]; then
        echo "❌ Directory '$SUBFOLDER' does not exist."
        continue
    fi
    
    if [ ! -d "$SUBFOLDER/.git" ]; then
        echo "❌ '$SUBFOLDER' is not a git repository."
        continue
    fi
    
    break
done

echo ""
echo "📁 Selected repository: $SUBFOLDER"
echo "📍 Full path: $(pwd)/$SUBFOLDER"

# Change to the repository directory
cd "$SUBFOLDER"

# Show current status
echo ""
echo "📊 Current repository status:"
git status --short
echo ""

# Ask for confirmation
read -p "❓ Are you sure you want to reset '$SUBFOLDER' to match remote? This cannot be undone! (y/N): " -n 1 -r
echo ""

if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "❌ Operation cancelled."
    exit 0
fi

echo ""
echo "🚀 Starting reset process for '$SUBFOLDER'..."

# Get the current branch name
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "📋 Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Fetch latest changes from remote
echo "📥 Fetching latest changes from remote..."
if ! git fetch origin; then
    echo "❌ Failed to fetch from remote. Check your internet connection and remote repository."
    exit 1
fi

# Clean all untracked files and directories
echo "🧹 Cleaning untracked files..."
git clean -fd

# Reset to match remote branch exactly
echo "🔄 Resetting to match origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH..."
if ! git reset --hard origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH; then
    echo "❌ Failed to reset. The remote branch might not exist."
    exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ Repository '$SUBFOLDER' successfully reset to match remote!"
echo "📊 Final status:"
git status

echo ""
echo "🏠 Returning to parent directory: $(dirname $(pwd))"
cd ..
```

## How to Use It

### 1. **Where to Run It**
Run this script from `/repos` (your parent directory):

```bash
cd /repos
./git-reset-to-remote.sh
```

### 2. **Setup Instructions**
```bash
# Navigate to your repos directory
cd /repos

# Create the script file
nano git-reset-to-remote.sh
# (paste the script content and save)

# Make it executable
chmod +x git-reset-to-remote.sh

# Run it
./git-reset-to-remote.sh
```

### 3. **Example Usage**
```bash
cd /repos
./git-reset-to-remote.sh

# The script will show:
# 📁 Available git repositories in current directory:
#    - myApp/
#    - anotherRepo/
#
# 📂 Enter the subfolder name (e.g., myApp): myApp
# 
# Then it will process repos/myApp
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Lists** all git repositories in the current directory
2. **Asks** which subfolder you want to process
3. **Validates** the subfolder exists and is a git repository
4. **Changes** into that directory
5. **Shows** current status
6. **Asks for confirmation**
7. **Processes** the reset (fetch, clean, reset)
8. **Returns** to the parent directory

## Safety Features

- ✅ Lists available repositories
- ✅ Validates subfolder exists and is a git repo
- ✅ Shows what will be deleted before proceeding
- ✅ Asks for confirmation
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Returns to parent directory when done

This way you can run it from `/repos` and it will process `/repos/myApp` (or any other subfolder you specify).
