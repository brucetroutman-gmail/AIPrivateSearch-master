# The Articles of Confederation

The articles of Confederation were a set of laws that established the structure of the United States government. They were created by the Constitution of 1787 and were intended to provide for the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of the states in relation to each other.

Article I of the Constitution sets forth the principle of the federal government being divided into three branches: Congress, the President, and the judiciary. The states retain their sovereignty and freedom from any form of government or authority that they do not explicitly grant them. This is known as the "Stile of this Confederacy" and it is expressed in Article II.

Article III sets forth the right to free speech, religion, and other rights for all citizens of the United States. The states are also required to provide for a free and equal education for all children, regardless of race or color.

Article IV provides for the right to freedom of movement and residence within the state, as well as the right to petition the government for redressal of grievances. This is known as the "free inhabitants" clause.

The articles of Confederation were intended to provide for the rights and responsibilities of the states in relation to each other, but they did not explicitly grant them any form of government or authority. The states had the power to tax, regulate commerce, and enforce laws that protected their citizens' rights and freedoms.
