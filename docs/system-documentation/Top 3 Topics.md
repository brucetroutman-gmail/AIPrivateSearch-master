    * **Declaration of Independence:** Outlines the colonists' grievances against British rule and their assertion that all men are created equal with inherent rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
    * **Articles of Confederation:** While a weak central government was established, it did lay the groundwork for future efforts towards greater autonomy and individual freedom.  
    * **US Constitution:** This document establishes a federal system that balances power between the states and the national government, ensuring citizens' rights are protected and their voices heard in government.

    * **US Constitution:** The US Constitution establishes a bicameral legislature (House of Representatives and Senate) and an executive branch headed by the President, all designed to provide for representation and accountability.

    * **Declaration of Independence:** The document outlines the colonists' grievances against British rule and their desire to establish a new nation based on liberty and justice. 
    * **Articles of Confederation:**  This document aimed to create a unified nation, but it ultimately failed due to its weaknesses in terms of national power and coordination.
