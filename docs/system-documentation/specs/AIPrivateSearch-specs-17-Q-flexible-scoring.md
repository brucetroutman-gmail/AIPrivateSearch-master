# AIPrivateSearch Specs v17 - Flexible Scoring & Security Enhancements

## Overview
This specification documents the flexible scoring model selection, security improvements, and user experience enhancements implemented after the performance optimizations (v16).

## Major Updates Since v16

### 1. Flexible Scoring Model Selection
**Dynamic Model Selection:**
- **Removed Hardcoded Models**: No longer uses fixed scoring models from config
- **User Choice**: Score model dropdown populated with all available Ollama models
- **Model Independence**: Search and scoring can use different models
- **Validation**: Requires score model selection when scoring is enabled
- **Testing Flexibility**: Enables comprehensive model comparison testing

**Benefits:**
- Compare scoring quality across different models
- Test model-specific biases and capabilities
- Optimize for speed vs accuracy based on use case
- Enable research into best scoring model combinations

### 2. Simplified Scoring Output
**Removed Justifications:**
- **Cleaner Display**: Removed "Justification" column from scoring table
- **Streamlined Export**: Simplified markdown export format
- **Backend Optimization**: Removed justifications from API responses
- **Focus on Scores**: Emphasis on numerical results only

**New Scoring Table Format:**
```
| Criterion     | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| Accuracy      | 3     |
| Relevance     | 2     |
| Organization  | 1     |
| Weighted Score| 67%   |
```

### 3. Enhanced Security & Privacy
**Environment Variable Protection:**
- **No .env Display**: Completely removed .env contents from console output
- **Silent Loading**: Dotenv configured with `quiet: true, debug: false`
- **Secure Startup**: No sensitive database credentials or configuration exposed
- **Clean Logs**: Server startup shows only essential information

**Port Management:**
- **Port 3000 Validation**: Checks availability before starting frontend
- **Clear Instructions**: Specific guidance to close Terminal windows if port busy
- **Graceful Handling**: Proper cleanup of backend processes on port conflicts

**File System Security:**
- **VS Code Integration**: Handles locked files during updates
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific instructions for file access issues
- **Safe Cleanup**: Prevents corruption during folder operations

### 4. Improved Scoring Prompt
**Enhanced Evaluation Criteria:**
```
Evaluate this answer using a 1-3 scale where:
1 = Poor/Incorrect
2 = Adequate/Mostly correct  
3 = Excellent/Completely correct

Query: [user query]
Answer: [model response]

Rate each criterion (1-3):
Accuracy (factual correctness): 
Relevance (addresses the query): 
Organization (clear structure): 

Respond with only three numbers, one per line.
```

**Improvements:**
- **Clear Scale Definition**: Explicit meaning for each score level
- **Specific Criteria**: Detailed explanation of what to evaluate
- **Better Formatting**: Structured prompt for consistent model understanding
- **Focused Output**: Requests only numerical scores

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

#### Form Validation
- **Score Model Required**: Cannot submit with scoring enabled but no score model selected
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific guidance for missing selections
- **Progressive Validation**: Checks requirements before processing

#### Model Management
- **Dynamic Loading**: All dropdowns populated from available Ollama models
- **Consistent Filtering**: Excludes embedding models from all selections
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Organized model lists for easy selection

## Updated Technical Architecture

### Flexible Scoring Stack
```
Frontend: Dynamic model selection with validation
Backend: Model-agnostic scoring with user selection
AI Models: Any available Ollama model for search/scoring
Validation: Required score model when scoring enabled
Security: Protected environment variables and ports
```

### Enhanced Search Flow
```
1. Model Selection - User chooses search and score models
2. Validation - Ensures required models are selected
3. Processing - Uses selected models for search and scoring
4. Results - Clean output without justifications
5. Export - Streamlined data format
```

### Security Improvements
```
Environment: No sensitive data in console
Ports: Validated before startup
Files: Protected during operations
Errors: Clear guidance without exposure
```

## API Enhancements

### Updated Scoring Endpoint
**POST /api/search**
```json
{
  "query": "What is the capital of France?",
  "score": true,
  "model": "qwen2:1.5b",
  "scoreModel": "gemma2:2b-instruct-q4_0",
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "context": 1024
}
```

**Response Format (Simplified):**
```json
{
  "response": "Paris is the capital of France.",
  "scores": {
    "accuracy": 3,
    "relevance": 3,
    "organization": 3,
    "total": 100,
    "overallComments": "Scores extracted from model response"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "search": {
      "model": "qwen2:1.5b",
      "temperature": 0.3,
      "context_size": 1024
    },
    "scoring": {
      "model": "gemma2:2b-instruct-q4_0",
      "temperature": 0.3,
      "context_size": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Updates

### Removed Hardcoded Settings
**Before (v16):**
```json
{
  "score-settings": [
    {
      "model": "qwen2:1.5b"
    },
    {
      "temperature": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**After (v17):**
```json
{
  "score-settings": [
    {
      "temperature": 0.3
    },
    {
      "context": 1024
    },
    {
      "maxtokens": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Capabilities

### Model Comparison Testing
**Scoring Model Evaluation:**
- Test same query with different scoring models
- Compare consistency across model families
- Identify model-specific biases or strengths
- Optimize model selection for specific use cases

**Example Test Scenarios:**
```
Query: "What is the capital of France?"
Search Model: qwen2:1.5b
Score Models: 
- qwen2:1.5b (Score: 1,2,3 = 44%)
- gemma2:2b-instruct-q4_0 (Score: 3,3,3 = 100%)
- llama3.1:8b (Score: 3,3,3 = 100%)
```

### Security Validation
- ✅ **No Environment Exposure**: Clean startup logs
- ✅ **Port Protection**: Proper port conflict handling
- ✅ **File Safety**: Protected operations during updates
- ✅ **Error Guidance**: Clear instructions without sensitive data

## Performance Impact

## User Interface Updates

### Enhanced Form Validation
```javascript
// New validation logic
if (scoreTglEl.checked && !document.getElementById('scoreModel').value) {
  outputEl.textContent = 'Please select a score model when scoring is enabled.';
  return;
}
```

### Simplified Results Display
```html
<!-- Removed justification column -->
<table class="score-table">
  <tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Score</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Relevance</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Organization</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Weighted Score</td><td>67%</td></tr>
</table>
```
