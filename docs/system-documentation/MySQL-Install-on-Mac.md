Below are the revised steps to install MySQL 8+ on a Mac using the DMG package, ensuring the caching_sha2_password authentication plugin is used (MySQL 8+ default), and configuring DBeaver to connect with this plugin. These instructions exclude Homebrew and focus on compatibility with caching_sha2_password.
Step 1: Install MySQL 8+ on macOS Using the DMG Package

Download MySQL Community Server:

Visit https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
Select the macOS version and download the DMG archive for MySQL 8+ (e.g., mysql-8.4.2-macos15-arm64.dmg for Apple Silicon or mysql-8.4.2-macos15-x86_64.dmg for Intel-based Macs).
Verify compatibility with your macOS version at https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html.


Install MySQL:

Open the DMG file and double-click the installer package (e.g., mysql-8.4.2-macos15-arm64.pkg).
Follow the on-screen instructions:

Accept the license agreement.
Use the default installation location (/usr/local/mysql/).
Choose “Use Strong Password Encryption” (default for MySQL 8+, enables caching_sha2_password) when prompted for authentication settings.
Set a root password and save it securely.


The installer creates a symbolic link at /usr/local/mysql.


Start MySQL Server:

The server may start automatically. If not, start it manually in Terminal:
bashsudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
Enter your Mac password if prompted.


Secure MySQL Installation:

Run the secure installation script to configure security settings:
bash/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_secure_installation

When prompted, keep the existing root password (set during installation).
Answer prompts to remove anonymous users, disallow remote root login, etc. Do not change the authentication method (keep caching_sha2_password).




Verify MySQL Installation and Authentication:

Check the MySQL version:
bash/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql --version
Expect output like mysql  Ver 8.4.2 for macos15 on arm64.
Confirm the root user uses caching_sha2_password:
bash/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
Enter your root password, then run:
sqlSELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root';
Verify the plugin column shows caching_sha2_password for root@localhost.


Configure MySQL Path (optional, for easier CLI access):

Add MySQL to your system path:
bashecho 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
For Bash, use ~/.bash_profile instead of ~/.zshrc.



Step 2: Install DBeaver on macOS

Download DBeaver:

Go to https://dbeaver.io/download/ and download the macOS DMG for the Community Edition (e.g., dbeaver-ce-24.2.0-macosx-cocoa-aarch64.dmg for Apple Silicon).
Ensure your macOS version is 11 (Big Sur) or later, as DBeaver 24.0.4+ does not support macOS 10.15 or earlier.


Install DBeaver:

Open the DMG and drag the DBeaver icon to the Applications folder.
If macOS blocks the app, right-click DBeaver in Applications, select “Open,” and confirm.


Verify Java Dependency:

DBeaver requires Java 21 or higher. Download and install it from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/ if needed.
Verify Java:
bashjava --version
Ensure it’s Java 21+.



Step 3: Configure DBeaver to Connect to MySQL with caching_sha2_password

Open DBeaver:

Launch DBeaver from the Applications folder.


Install the Latest MySQL Driver:

DBeaver must use a MySQL driver that supports caching_sha2_password (MySQL Connector/J 8.0.27 or later).
Go to “Database” > “Driver Manager.”
Select the “MySQL” driver, click “Edit,” and ensure the driver version is 8.0.27 or higher (e.g., 8.4.0).
If outdated, click “Download” to get the latest mysql-connector-java driver. Alternatively, manually download it from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ and add it to DBeaver’s driver settings.


Create a New MySQL Connection:

Click “Database” > “New Database Connection.”
Select “MySQL” (ensure it’s the MySQL 8+ driver, not “MySQL (old)” or “MySQL 5”) and click “Next.”
Enter connection details:

Host: localhost
Port: 3306
Database: Leave blank or specify a database (e.g., test_db) if created.
Username: root
Password: The root password set during MySQL installation.


Under “Driver properties” (optional, to ensure compatibility):

Click “Edit Driver Settings” and add:
textProperty: useSSL
Value: false
(Disable SSL if not configured; caching_sha2_password doesn’t require SSL but may need it for remote connections.)
Alternatively, enable SSL by adding certificates (advanced setup, not covered here).




Test the Connection:

Click “Test Connection.” If the driver supports caching_sha2_password, you should see a “Success” message.
If you get an authentication error, ensure the MySQL driver is updated and the root user uses caching_sha2_password (verified in Step 1.5).


Configure Local Client (Optional):

For native backup/restore, set the MySQL local client:

Right-click the connection in DBeaver, select “Edit Connection Settings.”
In “Local Client,” click “Browse” and select /usr/local/mysql-8.4.2-macos15-arm64/.




Finish and Test:

Click “Finish” to save.
In DBeaver’s Database Navigator, expand the connection to view databases/tables. Right-click a table and select “View Data” to test.



Step 4: Troubleshooting Common Issues

MySQL Server Not Starting:

Check for running MySQL instances:
bashps aux | grep mysql
sudo kill -9 <pid>

Remove older MySQL versions via the installer or by deleting /usr/local/mysql.


DBeaver Connection Errors:

Authentication Failure: Ensure the MySQL driver in DBeaver is 8.0.27 or later, as older drivers don’t support caching_sha2_password.
SSL Errors: If you see SSL-related errors, set useSSL=false in the driver properties or configure SSL certificates in MySQL and DBeaver.
Verify the MySQL server is running and port 3306 is open:
bashsudo lsof -i :3306



DBeaver Slow or Unresponsive:

Confirm Java 21+ is installed.
Update DBeaver to the latest version from https://dbeaver.io.



Step 5: Optional – Create a Test Database

In DBeaver, right-click your MySQL connection in the Database Navigator.
Select “Create New Database,” enter a name (e.g., test_db), and click “OK.”
Verify the database appears in the navigator.

Notes

Why caching_sha2_password?: It’s MySQL 8’s default, offering stronger encryption than mysql_native_password. DBeaver supports it with updated drivers (8.0.27+).
Driver Importance: Older MySQL drivers in DBeaver (pre-8.0.27) don’t support caching_sha2_password, causing connection failures. Always verify the driver version.
SSL Consideration: For local connections, disabling SSL (useSSL=false) simplifies setup. For production, configure SSL for security.
DBeaver Community Edition: Sufficient for MySQL with caching_sha2_password. Enterprise Edition is only needed for NoSQL or advanced features.

This setup ensures MySQL 8+ uses caching_sha2_password and DBeaver connects successfully. If issues arise, let me know for specific troubleshooting!2.1sHow can Grok help?
